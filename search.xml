        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>​       I think that friendship is the most beautiful thing in the world. It’s something as clear as crystal. It’s not a skill but a true feeling. If you have a good friend, you’ll feel the colourful life </p><p>​       Friendship is a kind of treasure in our lives. It is actually like a bottle of wine, the longer it is kept, the sweeter it will be. It is also like a cup of tea. When we are thirsty, it will be our best choice, but when we have enough time to enjoy ourselves, it is also the most fragrant drink.</p><p>​      When you’re down, friends lift you up. When you lose your way, friends guide you and cheer you on. Friendship is indispensable to people’s life. A man without friends is an angel without wings, whose life will suffer in the long tolerance of loneliness and depression. Friendship is the mother of our psyche, who’ll warm her kid when hurt occurs. We have much to share with our friends in life, perplexity, excitement, bitterness etc. It’s magnificent to maintain a genuine friendship. </p><p>​      How to make a friend. Understanding should come first. we should be good at observing and understanding the feelings and needs of our friends.Only when we get a better understanding of each other can we gain an authentic and meaningful friendship. We may find our hobbies of common interests. This feeling of affinity gets us closer and closer.    </p><p>​      Everyone wants to be noticed and cared for by others.When a friend is depressed, don’t show off your pride. When a friend is successful, applaud him sincerely. In these ordinary, each other will be moved, the relationship will be more harmonious.</p><p>​      Tolerance is the third essential part in friendship. We are absolutely different persons. This individual distinction may cause conflict between us in every aspect of our life. Don’t immerse ourselves in this infliction too long. Try to tolerant his/her in an introspective mood. Saints are not perfect, let alone those ordinary people like us. Afterwards, we should get a good communication. Never shy to confess.</p><p>​      Finally, let’s pray together now that one day, all of us could find the person we want to find, and could enjoy a real beautiful friendship in our lives. Let’s pray the flower of friendship be-tween our friends and us would always bloom brightly in our hearts.Remember, friendship is your psyche’s guard, treasure it.</p>]]></content>
